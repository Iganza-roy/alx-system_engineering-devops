# Web stack debugging #3

This directory contains my tasks on the web stack debugging #3 project

The goal here was to find out why Apache is returning a 500 error, fix the issue and then automate it using Puppet.

When debugging, sometimes logs are not enough. Either because the software is breaking in a way that was not expected and the error is not being logged, or because logs are not providing enough information. - Hence the need to go fullstack.
