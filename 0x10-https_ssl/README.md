# HTTPS SSL

This dir contains my tasks on the HTTPS SSL project:

**Hypertext transfer protocol secure** (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer.

SSL, or **Secure Sockets Layer**, is an encryption-based Internet security protocol.
