# Configuration management

This repo contains my tasks on the configuration management project.

configuration management (CM) refers to the process of systematically handling changes to a system in a way that it maintains integrity over time. Even though this process was not originated in the IT industry, the term is broadly used to refer to server **configuration management.**
