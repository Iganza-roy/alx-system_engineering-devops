### How to Read API Documentation to Find the Endpoints Youâ€™re Looking For
**Overview Section**: Start with the overview to understand what the API does, its base URL, and common terms used.
**Endpoints Section**: Look for a section dedicated to endpoints. This typically lists all available endpoints, often grouped by functionality.
**Endpoint Details**: For each endpoint, check:
 - URL and HTTP Method: The URL path and method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
 - Parameters: Query parameters, path parameters, headers, and body parameters.
 - Request Examples: Sample requests to understand how to format your calls.
 - Responses: Details on response formats, including status codes and JSON structure.
 - Error Handling: Information on potential errors and their meanings.

**API Pagination:** Use loop structures to handle pagination parameters and fetch all data.
**Parsing JSON:** Utilize the json module in Python to extract information from JSON responses.
**Recursive API Calls:** Implement recursive functions to continue fetching data based on response conditions.
**Sorting a Dictionary by Value:** Use the ```sorted``` function with a lambda function to order dictionary items by value.
