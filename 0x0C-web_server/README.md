This repo contains my tasks on the web server project

## How the web works
### Clients and servers
Computers connected to the internet are called clients and servers. A simplified diagram of how they interact might look like this:

- Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).
- Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.

### The other parts of the web:
- **Your internet connection:** Allows you to send and receive data on the web. 
- **TCP/IP:** Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet.
- **DNS:** Domain Name System is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website.
- **HTTP:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. 
- **Component files:** A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different parts of the goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:
	- **Code files:** Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, though you'll meet other technologies a bit later.
	- **Assets:** This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.
